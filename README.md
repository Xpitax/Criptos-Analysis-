# Criptos-Analysis
An analysis of cryptomonets; Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin. Scraping data from Twitter and Binance. Trying to demonstrate the unpredictability of cryptos through different statistical models (GARCH, ARIMA, Z Score)

An analysis of cryptomonets; Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin.
I scraped data on cryptomonets via the Binance API.
The objectives of the analysis were different:
- to demonstrate the unpredictability of cryptomonets using different statistical models (GARCH Model, ARIMA Model)
- to demonstrate that the trend of cryptocurrencies is sensitive to certain tweets depending on the topic and the person tweeting; 
the first step in this process was a Z Score Analysis to highlight the most obvious trend changes
the second step was scraping the tweets through a python library called Scweet
the last step was to match tweets with trend variability to demonstrate that the trend cold be, in part, influenced by those.
